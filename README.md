always try to store the images in flickr
replace the 2023 arduino workshop gallery link with the new one.

if you are going to change any folder structure pls mention that.

i fixed that flickr album responsive issue.
Don't change the events section styling 
i will fix its responsiveness within tomorrow.

If you have any doubts drop me a message in whatsapp or telegram.
